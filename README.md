##HashMatcher

This script searches recursively a tree of files and creates a list of their ed2k hashes. Then, it compares the list with the ed2k hashes of records of eMule Known.met. Known.met must be transformed to xls file, this can be carried out by MetViewer or Internet Evidence Finder. If xls is exported by IEF, please remove first column.

##KeywordSearcher

Use your Encase keyword file to search for matches in the filenames of known.MET records. The first matched keyword is displayed. Known.met must be transformed to xls file, this can be carried out by [MetViewer](http://www.gaijin.at/en/dlemmetview.php), or Internet Evidence Finder. Your keyword file must be saved in UTF8 encoding. This script tries its best to remove punctutatio characters, brackets etc.
